# RIDE

RIDE is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) exclusive for [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org) tests or tasks automation framework.

----

Robot Framework supports, since version 6.1, files with localized definitions. RIDE was updated to accept those files, and we are working on a localization project to have its GUI in the same languages supported by Robot Framework.
You can help in this localization project at [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/robotframework-ride) [![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/robotframework-ride/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/robotframework-ride)

## **Welcome to RIDE - next major release will be version 2.2**

If you are looking for the latest released version, you can get the source code from **[releases](https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE/releases)** or from branch **[release/2.1.5.2](https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE/tree/release/2.1.5.1)**

See the [release notes](https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE/blob/master/doc/releasenotes/ride-2.1.5.1.rst) for latest release version 2.1.5.1

**Version [2.0.8.1](https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE/tree/release/2.0.8.1) was the last release supporting Python 3.6 and 3.7**

**Version [1.7.4.2](https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE/tree/release/1.7.4.2) was the last release supporting Python 2.7**


**The current development version is based on 2.1.5.2, supports Python from 3.8 up to 3.14 (30th July 2025).**

Currently, the unit tests are tested on Python 3.10, 3.11 and 3.13 (3.13 is the recommended version).
We now have an experimental workflow on Fedora Linux 41, with wxPython 4.2.3 and Python 3.14.b2.
Likewise, the current version of wxPython, is 4.2.3, but RIDE is known to work with 4.0.7, 4.1.1 and 4.2.2 versions.

(3.8 &lt;= python &lt;= 3.14) Install current released version (*2.1.5.2*) with:

`pip install -U robotframework-ride`

(3.8 &lt;= python &lt;= 3.14) Install current development version with:

`pip install -U https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE/archive/develop.zip`

(3.8 &lt;= python &lt;=  3.14) Install current Release Candidate version (*2.2rc1*) with:

`pip install -U --pre robotframework-ride`
