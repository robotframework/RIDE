ifdef::env-github[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]

RIDE is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) exclusive for https://robotframework.org[Robot Framework] tests or tasks automation framework.

'''

Robot Framework supports, since version 6.1, files with localized definitions. RIDE was updated to accept those files, and we are working on a localization project to have its GUI in the same languages supported by Robot Framework.
You can help in this localization project at https://crowdin.com/project/robotframework-ride[Crowdin] image:https://badges.crowdin.net/robotframework-ride/localized.svg[Crowdin, link=https://crowdin.com/project/robotframework-ride]
