== **Welcome to the development version of RIDE - next release will be version 2.1**

If you are looking for the latest released version, you can get the source code from **https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE/releases[releases]** or from branch **https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE/tree/release/2.0[release/2.0]**

See the https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE/blob/master/doc/releasenotes/ride-2.0.rst[release notes] for latest release version 2.0.

**Version https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE/tree/release/1.7.4.2[1.7.4.2] was the last release supporting Python 2.7**


**The current development version is based on 2.0, supports Python from 3.6 up to 3.10 (1st March 2023).**

Currently the unit tests are only tested on Python 3.10 (which is the recommended version).
