    """A test library providing keywords for OS related tasks.

    `OperatingSystem` is Robot Framework's standard library that
    enables various operating system related tasks to be performed in
    the system where Robot Framework is running. It can, among other
    things, execute commands (e.g. `Run`), create and remove files and
    directories (e.g. `Create File`, `Remove Directory`), check
    whether files or directories exists or contain something
    (e.g. `File Should Exist`, `Directory Should Be Empty`) and
    manipulate environment variables (e.g. `Set Environment Variable`).

    *Pattern matching*

    Some keywords allow their arguments to be specified as _glob patterns_
    where:
    | *        | matches anything, even an empty string |
    | ?        | matches any single character |
    | [chars]  | matches any character inside square brackets (e.g. '[abc]' matches either 'a', 'b' or 'c') |
    | [!chars] | matches any character not inside square brackets |

    Unless otherwise noted, matching is case-insensitive on
    case-insensitive operating systems such as Windows. Pattern
    matching is implemented using Python's `fnmatch` module:
    http://docs.python.org/library/fnmatch.html

    *Path separators*

    All keywords expecting paths as arguments accept a forward slash
    (`/`) as a path separator regardless the operating system. Notice
    that this *does not work when the path is part of an argument*,
    like it often is with `Run` and `Start Process` keywords. In such
    cases the built-in variable `${/}` can be used to keep the test
    data platform independent.

    *Example*

    |  *Setting*  |     *Value*     |
    | Library     | OperatingSystem |

    | *Variable*  |       *Value*         |
    | ${PATH}     | ${CURDIR}/example.txt |

    | *Test Case* |     *Action*      | *Argument* |    *Argument*       |
    | Example     | Create File       | ${PATH}    | Some text           |
    |             | File Should Exist | ${PATH}    |                     |

        """Runs the given command in the system and returns the output.

        The execution status of the command *is not checked* by this
        keyword, and it must be done separately based on the returned
        output. If the execution return code is needed, either `Run
        And Return RC` or `Run And Return RC And Output` can be used.

        The standard error stream is automatically redirected to the standard
        output stream by adding `2>&1` after the executed command. This
        automatic redirection is done only when the executed command does not
        contain additional output redirections. You can thus freely forward
        the standard error somewhere else, for example, like
        `my_command 2>stderr.txt`.

        The returned output contains everything written into the standard
        output or error streams by the command (unless either of them
        is redirected explicitly). Many commands add an extra newline
        (`\\n`) after the output to make it easier to read in the
        console. To ease processing the returned output, this possible
        trailing newline is stripped by this keyword.

        Examples:

        some operating systems (notable Windows) original return codes
        can be something else, but this keyword always maps them to
        the 0-255 range. Since the RC is an integer, it must be
        checked e.g. with the keyword `Should Be Equal As Integers`
        instead of `Should Be Equal` (both are built-in keywords).

        How time is returned is determined based on the given `format`
        string as follows. Note that all checks are case-insensitive.
        Returned time is also automatically logged.

        1) If `format` contains the word 'epoch', the time is returned
           in seconds after the UNIX epoch. The return value is always
           an integer.

        2) If `format` contains any of the words 'year', 'month',
           'day', 'hour', 'min' or 'sec', only the selected parts are
           returned. The order of the returned parts is always the one
           in the previous sentence and the order of the words in
           `format` is not significant. The parts are returned as
           zero-padded strings (e.g. May -> '05').

        3) Otherwise, and by default, the time is returned as a
           timestamp string in the format '2006-02-24 15:08:31'.

        Examples (when the modified time of the ${CURDIR} is

        1) If `mtime` is a floating point number, it is interpreted as
           seconds since epoch (Jan 1, 1970 0:00:00). This
           documentation is written about 1177654467 seconds since
           epoch.

        2) If `mtime` is a valid timestamp, that time will be used. Valid
           timestamp formats are 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss' and 'YYYYMMDD hhmmss'.

        3) If `mtime` is equal to 'NOW' (case-insensitive), the
           current time is used.

        4) If `mtime` is in the format 'NOW - 1 day' or 'NOW + 1 hour
           30 min', the current time plus/minus the time specified
           with the time string is used. The time string format is
           described in an appendix of Robot Framework User Guide.
