    Original version posted by Connelly Barnes to python-list and available at
    http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2004-May/219465.html

    This version mainly has kill() changed to stop() to match java.lang.Thread.

    This is a hack but seems to be the best way the get this done. Only used
    in Python because in Jython we can use java.lang.Thread.
