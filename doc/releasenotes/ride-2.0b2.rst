`RIDE (Robot Framework IDE)`_ v2.0b2 is a new release with major enhancements and bug fixes.
This version v2.0b2 includes removal of Python 2.7 support. The reference for valid arguments is `Robot Framework`_ installed version, which is at this moment 5.0.1. However, internal library is based on version 3.1.2, to keep compatibility with old formats.

* This is the **first version without support for Python 2.7**.
* The last version with support for Python 2.7 was **1.7.4.2**.
* Support for Python 3.6 up to 3.10 (current version on this date).
* There are some important changes, or known issues:

  - On MacOS to call autocomplete in Grid and Text Editors, you have to use Alt-Space (not Command-Space).
  - On Linux and Windows to call autocomplete in Grid and Text Editors, you have to use Ctrl-Space.
  - On Text Editor the TAB key adds the defined number of spaces. With Shift moves to the left, and together with Control selects text.
  - On Text Editor the **: FOR** loop structure must use Robot Framework 3.1.2 syntax, i.e. **FOR** and **END**.
  - On Grid Editor and Linux the auto enclose is only working on cell selection, but not on cell content edit.
  - On Text Editor when Saving the selection os tests in Test Suites (Tree) is cleared.

**New Features and Fixes Highlights**

* Auto enclose text in {}, [], "", ''
* Auto indent in Text Editor on new lines
* Block indent in Text Editor (TAB on block of selected text)
* Ctrl-number with number, 1-5 also working on Text Editor:

  1. create scalar variable
  2. create list variable
  3. Comment line
  4. Uncomment line
  5. create dictionary variable

* Persistence of the position and state of detached panels, File Explorer and Test Suites
* File Explorer and Test Suites panels are now Plugins and can be disabled or enabled and made Visible with F11 and F12
* File Explorer now shows selected file when RIDE starts
* Block comment and uncomment on both Grid and Text editors
* Extensive color customization of panel elements via `Tools>Preferences`
* Color use on Console and Messages Log panels on Test Run tab

Please note, that the features and fixes are not yet closed. This pre-release is being done because it has important fixes.
