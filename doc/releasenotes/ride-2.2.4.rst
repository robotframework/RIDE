   `RIDE (Robot Framework
   IDE) <https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE/>`__ v2.2.4 is a new
   release with some enhancements and bug fixes. The reference for valid
   arguments is `Robot Framework <https://robotframework.org/>`__
   current version, 7.4.2. However, internal library code is originally
   based on version 3.1.2, but adapted for new versions.

   -  This version supports Python 3.9 up to 3.14.
   -  There are some changes, or known issues:

      -  🐞 - Rename Keywords, Find Usages/Find where used are not
         finding all occurrences. Please, double-check findings and
         changes.
      -  🐞 - In Grid Editor, private keywords defined in test suites
         with **Name** setting, will show with error color even if used
         correctly in another local keyword.
      -  🐞 - RIDE **DOES NOT KEEP** Test Suites formatting or
         structure, causing differences in files when used on other IDE
         or Editors. The option to not reformat the file is not working.
      -  🐞 - In Grid Editor, when showing settings, scrolling down with
         mouse or using down is not working. You can change to Text
         Editor and back to Grid Editor, to restore normal behavior.
      -  🐞 - In Files Explorer, when in floating window, the files tree
         is not always using all available space. Do a small resize of
         window to redraw.
      -  🐞 - The Test Suites Explorer, may be visible or hidden with
         F12, or toggled floating/docked, but content may disappear. You
         should try to make it reappear by toggling Files Explorer, F11,
         or by editing **settings.cfg**.

   **New Features and Fixes Highlights**

   -  Changed Auto-Save to only save when user is not typing, and if
      code is in error show message in status bar.
   -  Applied STC_LEX colorization on Code Editor (external files
      editor).

   **The minimal wxPython version is, 4.0.7, and RIDE supports the
   current version, 4.2.5, which we recommend.**

   *Linux users are advised to install first wxPython from .whl package
   at*
   `wxPython.org <https://extras.wxpython.org/wxPython4/extras/linux/gtk3/>`__,
   or by using the system package manager.
