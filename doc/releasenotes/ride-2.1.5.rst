   `RIDE (Robot Framework
   IDE) <https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE/>`__ v2.1.5 is a new
   release with some enhancements and bug fixes. The reference for valid
   arguments is `Robot Framework <https://robotframework.org/>`__
   current version, 7.3.2. However, internal library code is originally
   based on version 3.1.2, but adapted for new versions.

   -  This version supports Python 3.8 up to 3.13 (and also tested on
      3.14.a7 with wxPython 4.2.3).
   -  There are some changes, or known issues:

      -  🐞 - Rename Keywords, Find Usages/Find where used are not
         finding all occurrences. Please, double-check findings and
         changes.
      -  🐞 - Some argument types detection (and colorization) is not
         correct in Grid Editor.
      -  🐞 - In Grid Editor, private keywords defined in test suites
         with **Name** setting, will show with error color even if used
         correctly in another local keyword.
      -  🐞 - RIDE **DOES NOT KEEP** Test Suites formatting or
         structure, causing differences in files when used on other IDE
         or Editors. The option to not reformat the file is not working.
      -  🐞 - In Grid Editor, when showing settings, scrolling down with
         mouse or using down is not working. You can change to Text
         Editor and back to Grid Editor, to restore normal behavior.

   **New Features and Fixes Highlights**

   -  Added indication of **private** keywords in Grid Editor, keywords
      will show in *Italic*, and with error background, when they are
      used outside of Keywords section, or from different files.
   -  Added indication of **private** keywords in Details pop-up for
      keywords with tag **robot:private** or name starting with
      underscore, **'\_'** in Grid Editor.
   -  Modified the action of key TAB when selecting from
      auto-suggestions list in Grid Editor. Pressing TAB, selects the
      item and continues in cell editor.
   -  Fix cursor position when editing cells in Grid Editor.
   -  Added parsing of option **--name** or **-N** and **Name** setting,
      to allow running tests with them set.
   -  Fix broken installation of RIDE v2.1.4 by adding missing
      dependencies.
   -  Added **Tools->Library Finder...** to install libraries and
      **Help->Open Library Documentation...** . They share the same
      dialog, and definitions are recorded in \``settings.cfg`\`.
   -  Added context menu to install libraries and to open documentation
      in Grid Editor Import section. Same as above description.
   -  Added keyboard shortcuts **Ctrl-Shift-Up** and **Ctrl-Shift-Down**
      as alternatives to **Alt-Up** and **Alt-Down** to move rows in
      Grid and Text Editors.
   -  Improved vertical scroll in Grid Editor, by having main scroll
      bars out of cells.
   -  Fixed Create Desktop Shortcut by pointing executable to **python
      -m robotide**.
   -  Changed arguments parser to allow **--version** and **--help**
      functional in Windows.
   -  Improved auto-complete in Grid Editor, to allow several matches.
   -  Fixed white blocks on Tree due to failed animation when test
      execution is too rapid, causing crash on Windows.
   -  Added Settings Editor button to Preferences dialog, to edit
      settings.cfg.
   -  Created backup of settings.cfg to allow recovering some settings
      when broken upgrades.
   -  Changed some informative dialogs and JSON Editor to use the
      customized colors.
   -  Added current executing keyword and other statuses to TestRunner
      status bar.
   -  Modified import statements to allow running RIDE without Robot
      Framework installed or versions older than 6.0.
   -  Added Config Panel button to supported installed Plugins next to
      their name in Plugin Manager dialog.
   -  Added Config Panel button to Plugins, working examples in Text
      Editor and Test Runner.
   -  On Windows ignore false modification on files when opening Test
      Suites, causing confirmation dialog.
   -  Added divided Status Bar. Left side for main window, right side
      for Plugins. Working example in Text Editor, when selecting in
      Tree shows the filename in StatusBar.
