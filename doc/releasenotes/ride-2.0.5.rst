   `RIDE (Robot Framework
   IDE) <https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE/>`__ v2.0.5 is a new
   release with minor enhancements and bug fixes. The reference for
   valid arguments is `Robot Framework <http://robotframework.org>`__
   installed version, which is at this moment 6.0.2. However, internal
   library is based on version 3.1.2, to keep compatibility with old
   formats.

   -  This version supports Python 3.6 up to 3.10.
   -  There are some changes, or known issues:

      -  Newlines in Grid Editor are not visible when in navigation
         mode, but visible in edit mode.
      -  Auto suggestions in Grid Editor can be enabled to not use
         shortcut to show list.
      -  On Text Editor when Saving the selection of tests in Test
         Suites (Tree) is cleared.
      -  Test Suite with *\**\* Comments \**\** can be edited but
         newlines are introduced.
      -  Some argument types detection (and colorization) is not correct
         in Grid Editor.
      -  RIDE **DOES NOT KEEP** Test Suites formatting or structure,
         causing differences in files when used on other IDE or Editors.

   **New Features and Fixes Highlights**

   -  Added **FOR** scope markers (**IN**, **IN RANGE**, **IN
      ENUMERATE**, **IN ZIP**) to auto-complete list
   -  Added support to read environment variable **ROBOT_VERSION** to
      apply some conditions
   -  Added notes on Test Timeout Grid Editor field and in Preferences
      of Test Runner
   -  Keywords auto-suggestion in grid editor does not need shortcut
      anymore, if you want to enable or disable this feature you can
      config in \`Preferences -> Grid Editor -> Enable auto
      suggestions\`
   -  Made \\n visible when editing cells in Grid Editor (problematic in
      Windows)
   -  Changed alias marker on library imports to consider variable
      **ROBOT_VERSION**. If version is lower than 6.0, uses **WITH
      NAME**, otherwise will use **AS**
   -  Fixed auto-indent on block commands in Text Editor
   -  Fixed missing auto-enclosing when in Cell Editor in Linux
   -  Fixed RIDE will crash when using third party input method in Mac
      OS
   -  Fixed missing color definition for keyword call in Text Editor
   -  Fixed clearing or emptying fixtures (Setups, Teardowns), now
      removes headers and synchronizes Text Editor
   -  Fixed selection and persistance of colors in File Explorer and
      Project Tree panels
   -  Fixed not using defined color for help and HTML content
   -  Fixed missing newlines in sections separation

   We hope to implement or complete features and make fixes on next
   major version 2.1 (in the end of 2023).
