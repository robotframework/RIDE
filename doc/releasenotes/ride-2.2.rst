   `RIDE (Robot Framework
   IDE) <https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE/>`__ v2.2 is a new
   release with some enhancements and bug fixes. The reference for valid
   arguments is `Robot Framework <https://robotframework.org/>`__
   current version, 7.3.2. However, internal library code is originally
   based on version 3.1.2, but adapted for new versions.

   -  This version supports Python 3.8 up to 3.13 (and also tested on
      3.14.rc3 with wxPython 4.2.3).
   -  There are some changes, or known issues:

      -  üêû - Rename Keywords, Find Usages/Find where used are not
         finding all occurrences. Please, double-check findings and
         changes.
      -  üêû - Some argument types detection (and colorization) is not
         correct in Grid Editor.
      -  üêû - In Grid Editor, private keywords defined in test suites
         with **Name** setting, will show with error color even if used
         correctly in another local keyword.
      -  üêû - RIDE **DOES NOT KEEP** Test Suites formatting or
         structure, causing differences in files when used on other IDE
         or Editors. The option to not reformat the file is not working.
      -  üêû - In Grid Editor, when showing settings, scrolling down with
         mouse or using down is not working. You can change to Text
         Editor and back to Grid Editor, to restore normal behavior.

   **New Features and Fixes Highlights**

   -  Fixed duplicated resources in Tree (Project Explorer).
   -  Added Project Settings concept. The Project Settings is a file
      named **ride_settings.cfg** inside a directory named **.robot**
      located in the Test Suite directory.
   -  Fixed crash when renaming test cases names on Tree (Project
      Explorer), by cancelling with Escape or by adding a Space in the
      end.
   -  Fixed missing text colorization in suites and test settings on
      Grid Editor.
   -  Restored init and main scripts and texteditor, because some
      changes in Grid Editor were not being saved in Text Editor and
      would be lost.
   -  Fix faulty cell editor in settings of Grid Editor which would
      prevent to change to Text Editor and Run tabs.
   -  Added indication of **private** keywords in Grid Editor, keywords
      will show in *Italic*, and with error background, when they are
      used outside of Keywords section, or from different files.
   -  Added indication of **private** keywords in Details pop-up for
      keywords with tag **robot:private** or name starting with
      underscore, **'\_'** in Grid Editor.
   -  Modified the action of key TAB when selecting from
      auto-suggestions list in Grid Editor. Pressing TAB, selects the
      item and continues in cell editor.
   -  Fix cursor position when editing cells in Grid Editor.
   -  Added parsing of option **--name** or **-N** and **Name** setting,
      to allow running tests with them set.

   **The minimal wxPython version is, 4.0.7, and RIDE supports the
   current version, 4.2.3, which we recommend.**
