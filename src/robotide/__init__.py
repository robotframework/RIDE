"""RIDE -- Robot Framework test data editor

Usage: ride.py [inpath]

RIDE can be started either without any arguments or by giving a path to a test
data file or directory to be opened.

RIDE's API is still evolving while the project is moving towards the 1.0
release. The most stable, and best documented, module is `robotide.pluginapi`.
